        <h3>Rebel Poet</h3>
        <p>Kazi Nazrul Islam, popularly known as Nazrul, was a Bengali poet, writer, musician, and is revered as the national poet of Bangladesh. Regarded as one of the greatest poets in Bengali literature, Nazrul produced a large body of poetry, music, messages, novels, and stories with themes that included equality, justice, anti-imperialism, humanity, rebellion against oppression and religious devotion. Nazrul Islam's activism for political and social justice as well as writing a poem titled as "Bidrohī", meaning "the rebel" in Bengali, earned him the title of "Bidrohī Kôbi" (Rebel Poet).</p>
    
        <h3>Awesome Writer</h3>
        <p>The paragraph in the picture reads: “Nazrul’s writings explored themes such as love, freedom, humanity, and fundamentalism, including religious, caste-based and gender-based. Throughout his career, Nazrul wrote short stories, novels, and essays as well as Bengali ghazals and poems. He pioneered new music forms such as Nazrul Sangeet. Nazrul wrote and composed music for nearly 4,000 songs (many recorded on HMV and gramophone records), collectively known as Nazrul Geeti.”</p>
